## Wave: Building an Open Source Skill Learning Platform
Annie Wang, Spring 2025


### Introduction   

[Comment_1]: <> As an open-source learning platform, Wave was designed to enable people all over the world to learn together and share their knowledge in newly and uniquely developing subject areas. The mission of Wave is to address the missing parts of education and promote inexpensive, interactive, community-driven learning experiences on subjects that are often ignored by large mainstream educational institutions. Citing good practice recommendations in Karl Fogel’s **Producing Open Source Software, Ben Cotton’s Program Management for Open Source Projects**, and the Mozilla Foundation’s **Working Open** guide, the purpose, targets, characteristics, target audience, technical features, and operation strategies of Wave are detailed in this paper. By practicing open-source philosophy and open-source project management techniques, Wave hopes to build an ecological system of education that is sustainable and inclusive. This paper will discuss what makes the platform necessary, how it will be developed and maintained, and how both students and creators can benefit.
